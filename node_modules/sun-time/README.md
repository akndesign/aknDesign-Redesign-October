# sun-time :

Calculator of sunrise and sunset according to location(Long.,lat.) or city name .


# Install :

```bash
  npm install sun-time;

```
If you want to increase the potential of finding city  in local-database of city-coordinates  , we recommend to install `db-ctiy` package .

```bash
npm install db-city;
```

 However, `db-city` is a huge package (144 Mo) since it handles more than 3 Million cities . [(Read more about "db-city" ) & how to avoid RAM overload][1] .

 Anyway, `sun-time` has more than **23k** local cities .

# How to use :

```js
 var sun=require('sun-time');
```

## 1.  sun(LAT,LONG,ELEVATION) :

* Latitude is a real number between -90 and 90,
* longitude is between -180 and 180
*  elevation is a positive number specifying the height in meters with respect to the surrounding terrain.
The elevation parameter is optional.
* Return an object with 2 attributs :
  `i.e : {rise:"",set:""}`

* May returns  an array of objects if more than one city have the same name.

  ### Use cases :

    ```js
     sun(24.68773,46.72185)
       //->i am in Riyadh
      sun(24.68773,46.72185,20)
       // i am in mountain with height=20m
    ```

## 2.  sun([LAT,LONG,ELEVATION],date) :

 You can  retrieve sun's times according to **date** .

 *  **date**  :  You can use new Date() to specify today. Date can be also entered as a triple `[year, month, day]`. For example, [2009, 2, 26] specifies February 26, 2009.

        Since  `x-class` is one of `sun-time` dependencies , `Date.daysAgo`, `Date.daysNext`,`yesterday`,`tomorrow` functions are available as  `static` methods under `Date` class.

   ### Use cases :
    ```js
       sun([24,46],new Date())
      //-> new Date() is the default
       sun([24,46],[1989,11,25])
       // --> sun times at Nov 25,1989
       sun([24,46],Date.daysAgo(7));
       //--> before 1 week from now

    ```

## 3.  sun([LAT,LONG,ELEVATION],date,{format:"24h",tz:3,dst:0}) :

`sun` method is still overloaded by some options :

* **format** (DEFAULT: 24h):

   Output time format, according to the following table:



| Format  | Description                   | Example |
|---------|-------------------------------|---------|
| 24h     | 24-hour time format           | 17:35   |
| 12h     | 12-hour time format           | 5:35 pm |
| 12hNS   | 12-hour format with no suffix | 5:35    |
| Float   | Floating point number         | 17.35   |

* **tz** (DEFAULT : hours offset of System % GMT):

   The difference  to Greenwich time (GMT) **in hours**. If omitted or set to ``"auto"``, timezone is extracted from the system.

* **dst** (DEFAULT: 0):

   Daylight Saving Time: 1 if date is in daylight saving time, 0 otherwise.
    (summer time->1).

## 3.  sun(CITY_NAME) :

 ```js

        sun('Riyadh')
        //--> if city in the same country of system --> Works!
        //--------------
        //--> else, in this version, add timezone ("tz")
        sun('Tunis',new Date(),{tz:1})
        // "1" -> because Tunis (GMT+1)

        sun('கிரனாதா') // === sun("Granada")
```

   The last instruction proves that `sun-time` supports **i18n**

   ```js
        sun('London');
        // is the same
        sun('لندن')  ;
   ```


# 4. Get Directly `sunrise` or `sunset`

```js
sun.rise('Mecaa');
sun.set('Newyork');
```

`sun.rise` & `sun.set` are overloaded such as `sun` itself.
